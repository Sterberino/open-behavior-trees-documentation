# Introduction

<p class="paragraph-block">Open Behavior Trees is an open-source, flexible Behavior Tree implementation for Unity. It is inspired by BehaviorDesigner and other Behavior Tree implementations.</p>
<p class="paragraph-block">Behavior Trees are an industry-standard method of creating complex, modular, and flexible AI for video games, and without a built-in solution, the Unity engine lags behind other engines such as Unreal Engine. Popular implementations available on the Unity Asset Store can be as expensive as $80, which is an expense that hobbyists and independant developers may not be able to afford. This was my primary reason for creating this package.</p>
<p class="paragraph-block">If you enjoy this package, and the following documentation, I only ask that you let me know by starring the GitHub repo <a class="link" href="https://github.com/Sterberino/open-behavior-trees/">here</a>. Enjoy!</p>
